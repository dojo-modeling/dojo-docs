# Dojo Documentation

This is a Jekyll App using the [JustTheDocs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme. It is hosted with Github Pages.

## Running Locally

If you want to contribute to the documentation, the easiest way to do so is to run the Jekyll app locally. You can run it by pulling down the project, installing [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), and running:
- `bundle install` to install dependencies
- `bundle exec jekyll start -l` to run the server

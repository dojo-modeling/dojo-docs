# Dojo Documentation

This is a Jekyll App using the [JustTheDocs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme. It is hosted with Github Pages.

## Running Locally

If you want to contribute to the documentation, the easiest way to do so is to run the Jekyll app locally. You can run it by pulling down the project, installing [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), and running
- `bundle install` to install dependencies
- `bundle exec jekyll start -l` to run the server

## Page Order

If you want to add, remove, or change a top level page, you need to edit the `nav_order` in that page and all the subsequent pages. The current order of the pages is as follows:
1. Home (index.md)
2. Model Registration (model-registration.md)
3. Data Registration (data-registration.md)
4. Data Modeling (data-modeling.md)
5. AI Assistant (ai-assistant.md)
6.
7. Dojo API (dojo-api.md)
8. Documents (documents.md)
9. Model Execution (model-execution.md)
10. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ.md)
